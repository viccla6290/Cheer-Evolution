		<h1>Everything you need to know about Competitive Cheer!</h1>

		<p id="one">WHAT IS IT?</br> Competitive cheer also known as competition cheer is when different schools cheer teams or "All Star" cheer gyms compete against each other at cheer competitions. </br> At a typical competition teams perform a two and a half minute routine filled with jumps, tumbling, stunts, dance, and a pyramid. Judges score the routine based of difficulty and execution. </br>

		Competing as a team is very challenging and takes lots of focus and athleticism. Competitive cheer can be "CO-ED" meaning there can be boys as well as girls. For High School Cheer teams in each state compete in around 6-8 competitions with the last competition being qualifiers.Then the top 15 teams will advance to "states" which is where the grand state champion is announced.  </p>
		
		<p id="two">STUNTING</br>In both sideline and competitive cheer (Highschool and All Star) you stunt. In Competitions, You have three sets of stunt combinations performed throughout your routine.</br>

		To stunt you need to have two bases one being a main the other being a side, a backspot and a flyer combined together create a stunt group. In highschool competitive cheer there is 5 or 6 stunt groups.</br>

		 The first stunt performed is called the "elite stunt" This usually entails a full up or switch up or any other higher difficulty stunt followed by the flyer pulling a heel stretch.</br>

		Following the Elite stunt is the "secondary stunt" this is a less difficult stunt but can still get you points. This stunt is usually a switch up or Lib in extension.</br>

		 Lasty is the pyramid. In this stunt all 5 or 6 stunt groups link together and perform baskets, switch up, fullups, etc. all while connected. All of these components combined create your stunting portion of the routine and score sheet.

		<p id="three">TUMBLING</br>This is second most important on the score sheet. </br> The first Section is standing tumbling which is done by everyone on the mat. Tumbling ranges from a standing backhandspring to two backhandspring to a full. </br>

		Next is running tumbling, obviously as the difficulty increases you will gain more points. The simplest pass you can throw is a running round off backhandspring, as the difficulty increases you can throw things like a running round off backhandspring tuck and full or arabian. To get maximum points you need the majority of people on the mat to have running tumbling.

		<p id="four">UNIFORMS</br>Competitive Cheerleading uniforms are commonly made by the brands "Rebel Athletics" and "Varsity". Uniforms are designed in your school colors and oftentimes are full of rhinestones and glitter.</br>

		A majority of the time, uniforms have 2 parts to them, A leotard and a skirt or shorts. The leotard has your mascots name on it or school name and is longsleeve. Additions can be made to amplify your need on your uniform such as: ruffles, extra text, and sparkles.
